## Intro
 `edu` stands for **E**lements of **D**iscourse **u**nderstanding, a workshop proceeding. edu here is not `education`, not `element discourse unit` :D



## Human Question Answering 

The first article I read is *A computational theory of human question answering* by Wendy G. Lehnert. 



In short, I learn two things: 

(1) her thesis in the QUAML system is still the study of QA community today 

(2) her example shows some limitation with which the current work of me and Min also share.



More details later!
