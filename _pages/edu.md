## Intro
`edu` stands for **E**lements of **D**iscourse **U**nderstanding, a workshop proceeding. It is NOT education, not element discourse unit. :D

I believe most reader can understand the bib text:
```
@article{joshi1981elements,
  title={Elements of discourse understanding},
  author={Joshi, Aravind K and Webber, Bonnie L and Sag, Ivan A},
  year={1981}
}
```



## Human Question Answering 

The first article I read is *A computational theory of human question answering* by Wendy G. Lehnert. 



In short, I learn two things: 

(1) her thesis in the QUAML system is still what we study in QA community today. 

(2) her example shows some limitation with which the current work of me and Min also share (more details later).



I wish I can finish reading this proceeding in the meantime I finish writing my DiSQ draft :)
