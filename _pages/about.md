<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

## Why? Where? What?

Q1: **Why** do you make this website?
- Show my work. 
- Practice writing. Encourage myself to write more. 
- Communicate brave ideas. 

Q2: This is your `maximal` website, so **where** is your `minimal` website?
- It's here: [yisong.me](https://yisong.me)
- I will gradually pare things down in [yisong.me](https://yisong.me). It will make a one-page style, CV-like website only for essential things. 
- The idea is similar to the Green light/Red light thinking as [my advisor](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~kanmy/) told me. [yisong.me](https://yisong.me) is as simplistic as possible. [yisong.io](https://yisong.io) is as explorative as possible. 

Q3: **What** do you put in this website?
- Thoughts about NLP in a relaxed style. See [MLP Blog](https://yisong.io/MLP/). 
- Rigorous technical notes about NLP. See [one](http://karlstratos.com/#notes) I admire. 
- Videos. 
- Time managements.
